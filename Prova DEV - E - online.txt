Question 1 
Given: 
1. import java.util.Date; 
2. public class Example { 
3. public static void main(String args[]) {  
4. Date d1 = new Date (92, 11, 31); 
5. Date d2 = new Date (94, 11, 31); 
6. method(d1, d2); 
7. System.out.println("d1=" + d1.getYear() + "\nd2=” + d2.getYear());  8. } 
9. public static void method(Date d1, Date d2) { 
10. d2.setYear(98); 
11. d1 = d2; 
12. } 
13. } 
What’s the output? 
A. d1=92  d2=94 
Question 2 Given: 
B. d1=92  d2=98 
C. d1=98  d2=98 
D. d1=98 d2=94 
1. //****************************** 2. // file A.java 
3. //****************************** 4. package a; 
5. public class A { 
6. private int x; 
7. protected int y; 
8. public int m1() {return x;} 9. } 
10. //****************************** 11. // file B.java 
12. //****************************** 13. package b; 
14. import a.A; 
15. public class B extends A { 16. private int z; 
17. public void m2(A a){ 18. z = x; 
19. z = y; 
20. z = a.m1(); 
21. } 
22. }
Consider the following statements: I. Line 18 is valid because B extends A II. Line 19 is not valid because y is  protected   
III. Line 20 is valid because m1() is public 
A. Only I and II are correct 
B. Only I and III are correct 
C. Only II and III are correct 
D. Only III is correct 
Question 3 
What best defines an abstract class? 
A. The class must not have method definitions. 
B. The class must have a method definition returning nothing. 
C. The class must have a constructor that takes no arguments. 
D. The class cannot be instantiated as it is mainly for inheritance. 
Question 4   
Consider this small binary tree: 
14 
/ \ 
2 11 
/ \ / \ 
1 3 10 30 
/ / 
7 40 
What is the order of nodes visited using a post-order traversal? 
A. 1 2 3 7 10 11 14 30 40 
B. 1 2 3 14 7 10 11 40 30 
C. 1 3 2 7 10 40 30 11 14 
D. 14 2 1 3 11 10 7 30 40 
Question 5 
Consider the following statements: 
I. A Binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two child nodes, usually  distinguished as "left" and "right", and a tree with n nodes has exactly n−1 branches which  means its height is always n-1. 
II. A Queue is a FIFO data structure, which means that the first element added to the queue will  be the first one to be removed. 
III. A Hash Map is a data structure in which, if there’s no collision among the keys, you can  always find an element in O(1) time, even in the worst case. 
A. Only I and II are correct 
B. Only I and III are correct 
C. Only II and III are correct 
D. I, II and III are correct
Question 6 
In the following code, assume that Queue is not thread-safe, there is more than one Producer  thread and more than one Consumer thread running and this program is crashing on runtime. In  order to fix the code below how should you fill in lines (1), (2), (3) and (4)? 
Global variables
	Queue q; 
(1)
	Producer thread 
	Consumer thread
	runProducer(){  
while(true){ 
item = new item(); 
(2) 
if (q is not full){  
q.enqueue(item);  
(3) 
} 
(4) 
} 
}
	runConsumer(){  
while(true){ 
(2) 
if (q is not empty){  
item = q.dequeue();  
(3) 
} 
(4) 
} 
}
	



A. (1) mutex m;   
(2) m.lock(); 
(3) 
(4) m.unlock(); 
B. (1) 
(2) 
(3) 
(4) if(Consumer) sleep(1); else sleep(2); 
C. (1) semaphore guard; 
(2) wait(guard); 
(3) 
(4) signal(guard); 
D. Alternatives A and C are correct.

Subsets 
Write the function getSubSets() to compute and return all subsets of a given set A, which has  at most 4 elements. 
Use the Set data structure to represent all sets and sub-sets of your solution. A Set is a  collection that contains no duplicate elements and the order of elements is irrelevant. Consider  the following interface defined for Set: 
Method signature 
	Method description
	boolean add(Element e) 
	Adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present  (optional operation).
	boolean addAll(Set s) 
	Adds all elements from s that are not already present in this set.
	boolean contains(Element e) 
	Returns true if this set contains the specified element.
	boolean equals(Set s) 
	Compares the specified set s with this set for equality.
	Iterator<Element> iterator() 
	Returns an iterator over the elements in this set.
	boolean remove(Element e) 
	Removes the specified element from this set if it is present  (optional operation).
	int size() 
	Returns the number of elements in this set (its cardinality).
	Element[] toArray() 
	Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set.
	



Table: Set interface 
Input example: 
A=[1,2,3] 
Output for the given example: 
[[1,2,3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [1], [2], [3], []]* 
* this is the content of the Set which should be returned by the function. 
Your proposed solution can be written in pseudo-code or any well-known language (C, C++,  Java, etc) and you are free to implement any auxiliary functions. Besides, write down a  comment to the main function explaining how your function will work like the one below. 
/** 
* The function below will ... 
* - Obtain the input 
* - Iterate over the elements 
* … 
* - Print the output and return ... 
*/
